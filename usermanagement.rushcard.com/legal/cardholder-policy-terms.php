"<strong>You</strong>" and "<strong>your</strong>" means the person or persons who have received and are authorized to use the Card as provided for in this Agreement.

                                            <p>
                                                Your Card is a prepaid card, which allows you to access funds loaded to your Card account. You should treat your Card with the same care as you would treat cash. We encourage you to sign your Card when you receive it. This Card is intended for personal, family, or household use and not intended for business purposes. Your Card account does not constitute a checking or savings account and is not connected in any way to any other account you may have. The Card is not a gift card, nor is it intended to be used for gifting purposes. The Card is not a credit card. You will not receive any interest on the funds in your Card account. We may close your Card or refuse to process, suspend, or delay any transaction that we believe may violate the terms of this Agreement or represents illegal or fraudulent activity. You are responsible for notifying us immediately upon any change to your address, phone number, or email address. If your address changes to a non-U.S. address, we may cancel your Card and return funds to you in accordance with this Agreement.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Important information for opening a Card account</strong>: To help the federal government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>What this means for you</strong>: When you request a Card, we will ask for your name, street address, date of birth, Social Security Number, and other information that will allow us to identify you.  We may also ask to see a copy of your driver's license or other identifying documents at any time.  You may be limited in use and features until we have been able to successfully verify your identity.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Eligibility and Activation</strong>: Without limiting the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, to be eligible to use and activate the Card, you represent and warrant to us that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age or are at least 13 years of age and have your parent's or guardian's consent to obtain a Card; (ii) you are a U.S. citizen or lawfully residing in the 50 states of the U.S. or the District of Columbia (collectively, the "U.S."), excluding Vermont; (iii) you have provided us with a verifiable U.S. street address (not a P.O. Box); (iv) the personal information that you have provided to us is true, correct, and complete; and (v) you have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by and comply with its terms.

                                                    <p>
                                                        If you believe your Card has been lost, stolen, or used without your permission, call or write Customer Service IMMEDIATELY at the contact information found at the beginning of this Agreement.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission. Calling Customer Service is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Card account. If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Card without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Also, if your electronic history shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by your Card or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the earlier of the date you electronically accessed your Card account (if the unauthorized transfer could be viewed in your electronic history) or the date we sent the FIRST written history on which the unauthorized transfer appeared, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <strong>Your Card may have some additional protections against unauthorized use:</strong><br />
                                                        Under Visa's Zero Liability Policy, your liability for unauthorized transactions on your Card is $0.00 if you notify us promptly upon becoming aware of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use and you were not negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your Card. This policy limiting your liability does not apply to debit transactions not processed by Visa, certain commercial card transactions, or unregistered cards.

                                                        Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available on your Card by the amount of the transaction and applicable fees. If you use your Card number without presenting your Card (such as for an internet transaction or a mail order or telephone purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself. Subject to the limits identified in subsection b. below, you may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services wherever your Card is honored as long as you do not exceed the value available in your Card account.

In addition, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO EXCEED THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT IN YOUR CARD ACCOUNT THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION OR A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available in your Card account, you will remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and agree to pay us promptly for the negative balance. If your Card has a negative balance, any deposits will be used to offset the negative balance. We may also use any deposit or balance on another card you have with us to offset a negative balance on this Card.

                                                        <strong>Loading the Card account:</strong> You may add funds to your Card, called "loading," by: (i) Automated Clearing House ("ACH") loads (e.g., direct deposit); (ii) loading cash through one of our reload locations (a list is available at <a href="https://getru.sh/fundaccount" data-speedbump="false">getru.sh/fundaccount</a>; (iii) cashing an eligible check and transferring those funds to your Card via a third-party mobile check load provider, subject to the terms and conditions established by such third-party provider from time to time; and (iv) receiving funds from another Card via our Card-to-Card transfer service, which allows cardholders to authorize the transfer of funds from their Card accounts to other Card accounts by providing instructions via the Card program website. See the Limits table below for limitations on amount and frequency for different load methods. Each load may be subject to a fee as set out in the Long Form. If you arrange to have funds transferred directly to your Card from a third party through an ACH load, you must enroll with the third party by providing the bank routing number and direct deposit account number that we provide you. <strong>The only federal payments that may be loaded to your Card via ACH credit are federal payments for the benefit of the primary cardholder. If you have questions about this requirement, please call Customer Service.</strong> We will reject any loads that exceed the maximum balance allowed on your Card. There are also maximum load restrictions we may place on your Card when aggregated with any other Cards you have. You agree to present your Card and meet identification requirements to complete load transactions as may be required from time to time.

                                                    <p><strong>Split Transactions:</strong> If you do not have enough funds available in your Card account for a transaction, you may be able to instruct the merchant to charge a part of the purchase to the Card and pay the remaining amount with another form of payment.  These are called "split transactions."  Some merchants do not allow cardholders to split transactions or will only allow you to do a split transaction if you pay the remaining amount in cash.</p>

You will be charged a fee for Foreign Transactions in U.S. dollars as disclosed in the Long Form. If the Foreign Transaction results in a credit due to a return, we may not refund any fee that may have been charged on your original purchase.

                                                        You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase transaction originated by use of your Card, except as expressly provided herein. If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your Card account, you can stop any of these payments. Call or write to Customer Service with the contact information located at the beginning of this Agreement in time for us to receive your request three business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If we do not receive your request at least three business days before the scheduled payment date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to stop the payment. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure or refusal to do so, even if we accept your stop payment request. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. If we do not receive the written request within 14 days after you call, we may honor subsequent payments with your Card account. Unless you tell us that all future payments to a specific recipient are to be stopped, we may treat your stop-payment order as a request concerning one specific payment only.

Please note that the person you are going to pay may give you the option of receiving notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.

                                                        With certain types of purchases (such as those made at restaurants, hotels, or similar purchases), your Card may be "preauthorized" for an amount greater than the transaction amount to cover gratuity or incidental expenses.  Any preauthorization amount will place a "hold" on your available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase.  Once the final payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed.  During this time, you will not have access to preauthorized amounts.  If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds.

If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your Card account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not provisionally credit your Card account. </p>

                                            <p>We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation.  If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.  You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

                                                    <h4>Personal Identification Number ("PIN")</h4>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When you activate your Card, you must select a PIN to be assigned to your Card.  If you load funds onto your Card without setting a PIN, you will not be able to access the funds until you set your PIN.  You should not write or keep your PIN with your Card.  Never share your PIN with anyone and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that appears to be modified or suspicious.  If you believe that anyone has gained unauthorized access to your PIN, you should contact Customer Service immediately.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, the return and refund will be handled by the merchant. If the merchant credits your Card, the credit may not be immediately available. While merchant refunds post as soon as they are received, please note that we have no control over when a merchant sends a credit transaction and the refund may not be available for a number of days after the date the refund transaction occurs. We are not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any goods or services you purchase with your Card.

                                                    <p>
                                                        If you need to replace your Card for any reason, please contact Customer Service. See the Long Form for applicable fees. Please note that your Card has a "Valid Thru" date on the front of the Card. You may not use the Card after the "Valid Thru" date on the front of your Card. However, even if the "Valid Thru" date has passed, the available funds on your Card do not expire. You will not be charged a fee for replacement cards that we send due to expiration of the Card.

We reserve the right to close your Card account should you complete or attempt to complete any of the prohibited actions in this Agreement.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Regardless of where or how we are served, we will comply with any state or federal legal process, including, without limitation, any writ of attachment, adverse claim, execution, garnishment, tax levy, restraining order, subpoena, or warrant we believe to be valid relating to you or your Card. You agree that we will honor legal process that is served personally, by mail, or by facsimile transmission at any of our offices (including locations other than where the funds, records, or property sought is held), even if the law requires personal delivery at the office where your Card account records are maintained. You agree that we will have no liability to you for honoring any such legal process. You also agree that we will have no obligation to assert on your behalf any applicable exemptions to execution or attachment under any applicable state or federal law. We will enforce a right of security interest against any of your Card accounts in order to reimburse us for our fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and expenses, in complying with legal process. We may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your Card account until such legal process is satisfied or dismissed, even if such action results in insufficient funds to satisfy an obligation you may have incurred. We may deduct such expenses from your Card account or any other account you may have with us without prior notice to you, or we may bill you directly for such expenses and fees. You agree to release and indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from all actions, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and damages, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, associated with our compliance with any legal process. When we receive an order instructing us to restrict access to funds in a Card account, we may remove the funds from the Card account and maintain them separately.

However, if the change is made for security purposes, we can implement such change without prior notice.  We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at any time (for example, assessing a fee less than described, or not all, for any reason does not waive our right to begin charging the fee as set forth in this Agreement without notice).  If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any governmental agency, local, state, or federal, the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement will not be affected.  This Agreement will be governed by the law of the state of South Dakota, except to the extent governed by federal law.  Should your Card have a remaining balance after a certain period of inactivity, we may be required to remit the remaining funds to the appropriate state agency.

The Arbitrator must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The Arbitrator must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.

The notice must explain in reasonable detail the nature of the Dispute and any supporting facts. If you are the complaining party, you must send the notice in writing (and not electronically) to our Notice Address. You or an attorney you have personally hired must sign the notice and must provide the Card number and a phone number where you (or your attorney) can be reached. A letter from us to you will serve as our written notice of a Dispute. Once a Dispute notice is sent, the complaining party must give the other party a reasonable opportunity over the next 30 days to resolve the Dispute on an individual basis.

To start an arbitration, the complaining party picks the administrator and follows the administrator's rules. If one party begins or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party begins a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.

However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.

                                <p>
                                    You are required to create login credentials prior to using the Mobile App. The login credentials
                                    you establish are used to log into your Card account.
                                </p>

                                    The Mobile App allows you to view information about your Card account, such as Card balance
                                    and transaction history. The Mobile App also describes various ways you can fund your Card
                                    account, including by using a Green Dot MoneyPak. The Card balance shown by the Mobile
                                    App may differ from your records because it may not include transactions in process,
                                    outstanding authorizations, or other items. If you think there is an error in your Card account
                                    information, you must telephone or write to us as soon as possible. For instructions about what
                                    to do and how to contact us in case of errors or questions on your Card transactions, please
                                    refer to your Cardholder Agreement (also available on the RushCard website). It is important
                                    that you access your Card information from time to time to ensure that no unauthorized
                                    transactions have occurred in your Card account. For additional transaction history information,
                                    you should access your Card account information online at the RushCard Card website.

                                        Security: Protecting the security of your information is very important to us. When you
                                        transmit login credentials from your Device to our servers, your information is protected by both
                                        a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized
                                        visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL
                                        (secure socket layer) encryption. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable
                                        precautions to ensure its security on our third party service provider's systems. Unfortunately,
                                        no data transmission via a mobile device can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
                                        while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
                                        security of any information you disclose or transmit to us via your Device and vice versa and we
                                        cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. By
                                        using the Mobile App, you acknowledge this risk when using the Mobile App.

                                    and you irrevocably agree to the jurisdiction of such courts.

                                    <u>Assignment</u>: You may not assign these Terms of Use without Green Dot's prior written consent.

                                <p>
                                    <u>Entire Agreement</u>: These Terms of Use represent the entire agreement between you and us in
                                    connection with the Mobile App, which may only be amended as described in these Terms of
                                    Use. If any provision of these Terms of Use are deemed unlawful, void or for any reason
                                    unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and
                                    shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <u>Export Control Laws</u>: You acknowledge that the laws and regulations of the United States and
                                    other countries may restrict the export and re-export of the Mobile App. You agree that you will
                                    not export or re-export the Mobile App in any form or to any recipient whether inside or outside
                                    of the United States in violation of applicable United States and foreign law.

                                    <u>Additional Provisions</u>: The Mobile App is void where prohibited by law. The failure to enforce
                                    any term of these Terms of Use on one occasion shall not prevent enforcement on any other
                                    occasion or the enforcement of any other term. Headings and captions shall not be considered
                                    included for purposes of interpretation or application hereof, but are for convenience only. Some
                                    states do not allow limitation of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain
                                    damages. If any provision is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will
                                    remain in effect.
                                </p>
