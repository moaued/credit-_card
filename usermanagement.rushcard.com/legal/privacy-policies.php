This Technology Privacy Statement ("<strong><i>Privacy Statement</i></strong>") describes the types of information collected, used, and shared by Green Dot Corporation, Green Dot Bank d/b/a GoBank, and their subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "<strong><i>Green Dot</i></strong>," "<strong><i>we</i></strong>," "<strong><i>us</i></strong>," and "<strong><i>our</i></strong>") when you visit our websites, including our social media pages that we control, or use our mobile applications. If you are a California resident, please see the "Additional Information Regarding California" section below for further information on our collection and use of your personal information.</p>
                        <p>For information on how we collect, store, share, and otherwise use your personal information that is obtained in connection with your application for or use of our financial products or services, please see the Privacy Policy associated with that product or service; however, this Privacy Statement will apply to our collection, storage, sharing, and use of information from and about you, obtained in connection with your access to and use of our websites and mobile applications.</p>

                        <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>

                        <h4>Information You Provide</h4>
                        <p>We collect personal information from you when you choose to share it with us. This may include when you access or use our websites or mobile applications, create an online account with us, request information from us, sign up for our newsletters or our email lists, participate in a promotion, or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect may include your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, information about your payment at a retail location, information contained on a check that you upload for remote deposit, financial account information used for payments, loads or direct deposits, and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
                        <p>We also collect your information via third-party social networks when you use them to connect with us (for example, by posting comments on our posts or sending messages to us). If you choose to connect with us on third-party social networks, we may have access to certain information about you from that social network, such as your profile name, profile picture, networks, username and user ID, and comments, questions, and other posted content based on your privacy settings on that social network.</p>
                        <h4>Information Automatically Collected</h4>
                        <p>
                            We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, local shared objects (Flash cookies), and other technologies for security and authentication purposes, to collect certain information when you visit and use our websites or mobile applications, to deliver online advertisements that we think would be more relevant to your interests, to monitor interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to allow us to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information that enable us to improve our websites, mobile applications, products, and services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your browser type and version, device type, Flash version, operating system, Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address, unique device identifier of your computer(s) or device(s) that are used to access our websites or mobile applications, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed our websites or mobile applications. We may also collect information about your browsing and use behavior, such as the date and time you visit our websites or use our mobile applications, the areas or pages of the websites or mobile applications that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the websites or mobile applications, the number of times you return to the websites or mobile applications, other click-stream or website or mobile application usage data, emails that you open, forward, or click-through to our websites, other websites that you may visit, and your activity on our websites and mobile applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you use certain features of our websites or mobile applications that involve location-based services (such as the ATM locator), we may also collect location information in order to: (1) provide you with the services or products that you request, including access to location-based information, and (2) monitor for fraud or other suspicious activity. The ways in which we collect location information, and the type of location information we collect, depend on the devices you use to access our websites or mobile applications and the settings for those devices. You may also manually enter a location (such as address, city, and postal code) to use the location-based services of our websites and mobile applications.</p>
                        <p>You can stop sharing location information with us at any time through your device or web browser settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device. If you stop sharing your location, certain features of our websites and mobile applications may not function properly or at all. If you have specific questions about the privacy settings of your device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your device, your mobile service provider, or web browser provider for help.</p>
                        <h4>Tracking, California Do Not Track Disclosures, and Ad Choices</h4>
                        <p>Certain parts of our websites require cookies. You are free to set your browser or operating system settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features of our websites or take full advantage of all our offerings. Please refer to your browser's or operating system's website or "Help" section for more information on how to delete cookies and/or disable your browser or operating system from receiving cookies or controlling your tracking preferences.</p>
                        <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers.</p>

                        <p>We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our websites and mobile applications and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, mobile apps, and online resources.

                        <p>We and our network advertisers may periodically show you online ads for products and services you might be interested based on your visits to both our websites and other websites (a process known as "behavioral advertising"). In order to do this, we need to place a cookie or other tracking device on your device. If you prefer to not receive online ads in this manner, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by tracking your browsing habits via cookies or other tracking devices.</p>
                        <p>To learn more about the use of cookies and other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Statement, please visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#/">http://optout.aboutads.info/#/</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/</a>. You may download the AppChoices app at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> to opt out in mobile applications. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It only means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.</p>

                        <h4>Combination of Information</h4>
                        <p>We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including information you provide to us and information we automatically collect through our websites or mobile applications, as well as information collected from other online sources or from third-party sources to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our websites, mobile applications, products, and services.</p>
